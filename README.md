# Tipcat
**Tip calculator**

Swift project submission for codepath based on this tutorial: https://vimeo.com/102084767. 

This project took 4 hours to complete:
* 1 hour - basic functionalies with no styling
* 1 hour - UI sketches and asset creation
* 2 hour - app styling. I had some issues with background image not filling the screen so I spent additional time looking up solutions online.

Completed user stories:
* Required - User can enter bill amount 
* Required - User can change tip percentage
* Required - User can dismiss keyboard
* Optional - Added app icon, launch image, and background image

# Tipcat
**Tip calculator**

Swift project submission for codepath. This project took 4 hours to complete:

* 1 hour - basic functionalies with no styling
* 1 hour - UI design and asset creation
* 2 hour - app styling. I had some issues with background image not filling the screen so I spent additional time looking up solutions online.

All required tasks were created. Added an app icon, a launch image, and a background image.
